WorldWideWebcam

Welcome to my first project,  WorldWideWebcam!   I created this webcam viewer in order to view scenes from around the world.  Ive included three viewing options: Choose a Scene (category), Surprise Me (random),  LIVE (random but only displays a currently streaming webcam).

Technologies used:

Getting Started:

How to use:
  Select a scene from the dropdown,  or click on either the Surprise Me or LIVE only buttons.  Once a webcam shows up on the screen, press play to view.
  
  
Future Enhancements:
  1. Additional dropdown menus to select country and/or city
  2. The ability to favorite a specific webcam in order to return to it at any time.
